As for the hosting model, Hadoop can be on a physical server or virtual machine, can be deployed on a cloud, or can also be deployed in a hybrid version running on a physical machine or through the cloud. In order for Java or Python to access Hadoop, a Java API called HDFS, Hadoop distributed file system, is enabled in the system.
